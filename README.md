# My_Jet

This is my first full stack project with using specific frameworks and tools (FastAPI, MongoDB).
I got inspired by a company called [**NetJets**](https://www.netjets.com/en-us/). They provide luxurious services to customers who need to ride private jets
as their transportation.
My_Jet helped me to understand how the web application works in our web browser and how backend plays an important role as a server-side
software. This project took a month to finish (including adding comments to my code).

* I used [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to create a RESTful API.
The reason why I chose this framework is... 
  - I'm familiar with using Python.
  - It is one of the fastest Python frameworks.
  - It automatically creates a documentation for this project (Swagger UI).

* I used [**MongoDB Motor**](https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for the database. The reason why I chose this driver is...
  - Motor is an async driver that uses Python.
  - MongoDB is one of the famous database tools, and it does not require SQL (it is a non-relational document database).
