This txt file includes some simple feedbacks that I've made while doing this project.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------FEEDBACK----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I should've used React or any other specific JavaScript library to create a better looking user interface (might study JavaScript one day).

2. I tried to create the PUT (update) and DELETE (delete) methods to create a whole RESTful API, but I realized the <form action="" method=""> from HTML code,

   the "method" attribute only supports GET and POST methods. Therefore, I changed the DELETE (delete) crud method to a normal function.

   In addition, I did not include the PUT (update) method to the project.

3. To be honest, the logic of authentication was not easy to study. I especially had a hard time about understanding how to store the JWT Token.

   Storing JWT Token inside the browser can be dangerous and possibly hacked by specific attacks such as XSS or CSRF attacks.

   In this program, I selected to store JWT Token in Cookies. It is not safe from CSRF attacks, but I stored tokens in 'HttpOnly' cookies and also I decreased

   the expiry time to 10 minutes for the security.

4. The 'password' attribute from UserInDB pydantic model does not have a strict format (ex: the password should be at least ten characters with two numbers).

5. The 'full_name' attribute also not requires any strict format (ex: user should add a space between their full name: Hello World O / HelloWorld X).
